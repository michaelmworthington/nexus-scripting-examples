== Integration API Scripting Examples

Example projects for the Integration API as documented in https://help.sonatype.com/display/NXRM3/REST+and+Integration+API

See what other interesting scripts have been created at https://community.sonatype.com

Getting Started
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Look at the examples in these projects to get more familiar with how to load, run, and write your own scripts to run inside of Nexus Repository Manager.

Step 1 - simple-shell-example:: simple JSON script files and shell scripts for interaction with the REST API
Step 2 - nexus-script-example:: Maven project for script development with IntelliJ IDEA-supported code completion
Step 3 - complex-script:: complex provisioning setup based on a shell script invoking numerous groovy scripts for upload and execution

Passing Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When running the script, the body of the POST request will be passed to your groovy in the _args_ field. You can treat this as a normal string, use Groovy's JsonSlurper to parse it as JSON, or read in any other groovy way.

The link:simple-shell-example/echo.json[echo.json] sample shows this in action. To test it out: 

. First, cut and paste the contents of _echo.json_ into the body field in the Nexus API UI for adding a new script and give your script a name, and click the "execute" button to submit the POST _/v1/script_ request to save the script in your instance of Nexus Repository Manager
. Next, using the name from Step 1, execute the POST _/v1/script/{name}/run_ request with any text you choose in the body.
. Notice that the response for Step 2 will return the text that you passed in!

For a more interesting example, see link:complex-script/addRole.groovy[addRole.groovy] and the corresponding documentation at the bottom of https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3/rest-and-integration-api/script-api/examples. This script allows you to create your own custom REST API that enables you automate the creation of new Roles inside of Nexus Repository Manager.


API Reference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are 4 officially supported API interfaces:

. Core
. BlobStore
. Repository
. Security

To learn more about the methods in each interface, use code complete in your favorite IDE with the +nexus-script-example+ project, or take a look at the Javadoc https://michaelmworthington.github.io/nexus-book-examples/scripting/apidocs/index.html[index.html]
